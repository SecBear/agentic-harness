# Specifications

Specs are the durable source of truth for intended behavior. Created during bootstrap, updated
as the project evolves.

## How To Use These Specs

- Treat `specs/` as the single source of truth for requirements.
- Each spec states what exists and what must still be built.
- Tests and examples should prove each spec section.

## Index

<!-- Bootstrap populates this table. Add new specs as the project grows. -->

| Spec | Domain | Summary |
|------|--------|---------|
| `specs/00-vision-and-non-goals.md` | Product/Philosophy | What this project is for, and what it is not |
