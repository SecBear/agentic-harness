# Vision And Non-Goals

<!-- Bootstrap fills this in based on what it finds in the project. -->

## Status

<!-- Every spec has a Status section with checkboxes. The agent uses this to know what's
     implemented and what still needs work. The planning pass (PROMPT.md) scans these to
     populate fix_plan.md. -->
